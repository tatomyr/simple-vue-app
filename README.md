* Clone this repo and type `$ npm i`. Make sure you're using the latest version of node/npm.
* Change files inside the `src/` folder. All the site content should be placed inside the `src/content/` folder. All 3rd party libraries should be placed inside the `src/lib` folder. All `*.html` files should be placed in the root of the `src/` folder.
* To start working on project type `$ gulp`. After that you'll get access to main page on `localhost:3000`.
* You should use specified version of node (in this case it's 8.x.x).
* You can try to start project with `$ ./start.sh` (you need to have nvm installed on your machine).
